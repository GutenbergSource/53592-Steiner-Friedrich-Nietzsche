<HTML><BODY>Before Rudolf Steiner became openly involved in occultism, he pursued a career in literature and philosophy, and published this study of Nietzsche.

<p>The book is in German, but printed in a modern font, so poses little difficulties. 

<p>For the opening and close quotes, please use the common quotation mark (") instead of the low double comma. Please do not use guillemets (Gänsefüßchen), except if they actually appear in the work.

<p>Please do not modernize the spelling. Keep old spellings as they are in the original!

<p>When you encounter the long s (&#383;) followed by a normal s, please just use ß for the combination, so proof, for example, da&#383;s as daß, not as dass.</BODY></HTML>
